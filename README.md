# Collaborative Filtering Movie Recommendation System Using Deep Learning

## Project Overview
This project involves building a deep learning-based collaborative filtering recommendation system using the MovieLens 1M Dataset. The primary task was to create and evaluate a recommendation system that predicts user ratings for movies. Additionally, a comparison was made between the deep learning-based model (NCF - Neural Collaborative Filtering) and a traditional matrix factorization model. An extended challenge was also undertaken to develop a hybrid model that combines collaborative and content-based filtering.

## Features
- **Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF)**: A deep learning-based recommendation model that leverages user-item interactions.
- **Matrix Factorization**: A traditional collaborative filtering model to compare performance with NCF.
- **Hybrid Model**: A combination of collaborative filtering and content-based filtering to enhance recommendation diversity and accuracy.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: The models were evaluated using **RMSE**, **MAE**, **Precision@K**, **Recall@K**, and **NDCG@K** to assess both rating prediction and ranking performance.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Implemented Random Search to fine-tune the model performance.
